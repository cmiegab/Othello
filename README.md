# Othello
C++23 implementation of the Othello board game. Initialised during a certified C++ advanced course.
Commonly 2D arrays are used to represent the state, but this implementation uses Bitboards for minimal memory usage and fast operations.
Bitboards are unsigned 64-bit integers where each bit represent a square on the board. Using bitwise operations, the game state can be manipulated efficiently.

The Course plan includes:
- C++ basics (streams, objects, namespaces etc.)
- Unit Testing
- STL library (container, templates, algorithms)
- Multithreading
- Networking
- Working with Databases and files
- GUI programming with Qt

In addition, more advanced topics are pursued outside the course:
- Design patterns (MVC)
- Hardware acceleration with SIMD instructions (AVX2, AVX-512)
